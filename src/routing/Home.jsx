      <p>Routing in reactJS is the mechanism by which we navigate through a website or web-application. Routing can be server-side routing or client-side routing. However, React Router is a part of client-side routing. Before proceeding further it is highly recommended you go over the official React.js certification course to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of React.  

React Routing without any knowledge of it can be manually implemented using useState and JSX for conditioning. But being inefficient for large-scale applications like e-commerce, it still can act as a boilerplate for understanding routing and act as a base for React JS router for example.</p>
